# Three Markdown Editors/Viewers

All three run in your browser and do not need a backend. A static file server should be enough.

... oh, and all three stand on the shoulders of Giants: [marked.js](https://ace.c9.io/) and [ace.js](https://github.com/chjj/marked)!

The [basic one](basic-markdown-editor/README.md) does the job, but barely.

The [better one](better-markdown-editor/README.md) does the job and has live preview.

The [ultimate one](ultimate-markdown-editor/README.md) has all the features. All of them.
